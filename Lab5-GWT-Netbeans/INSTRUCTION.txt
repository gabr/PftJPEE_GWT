1.   The project requires installation of the following elements:
  a)  GWT4NB plugin
  b)  GWT SDK version 2.4.0

  The SDK is specified while creating the project and picking the Google Web Toolkit framework.

2.  Note that the module was renamed to 'main' so after adding GWT RPC Service make sure that in web.xml the servlet
  is mapped under the url address starting with /main/.
